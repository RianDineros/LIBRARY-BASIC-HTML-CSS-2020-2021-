                    <p> SUMMARY :  A Haunted House," by Virginia Woolf, tells the story of a married couple whose home is haunted by two ghosts. The ghosts, however, mean the couple no harm and simply open and close doors and windows in a desperate search for treasure, which the living couple believes does not exist in the house.
